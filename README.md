# What are the benefits of chatbots?




Chatbots look like a cool thing to play around with.
But what is the target of chatbots? Why do companies use bot assistants instead of offering a more human customer service?
Here are some obvious benefits of using chatbots:
Faster replies. Even the fastest human need some time to write in an appropriate response. Bots can send responses in milliseconds.
24 hrs support. Bots don’t need to rest, and they never get bored. Chatbots work for free and limitless.
Better user experiences. About forty percent of customers prefer bots to other forms of customer service. While some still prefer to wait for a real person, it is important to provide a solution that delivers the best customer experiences.
More customer interactions. Chatbots increase customer engagement levels. Their reply rates are quite higher than engaging customers via email or contact forms. 
Many integrations with messaging apps. Chatbots provide multi-channel customer service and can work on many different messaging platforms meanwhile.
Conversation templates. Many chatbots have a library of many different industries.
Great return on investment for businesses. The costs of deploying a chatbot on your website or social media are insignificant. A single bot can do the work of a whole call center.
Their primary target is to facilitate human interaction.
On top of that, this new technology is becoming quite popular. Over 1.400.000 people have already used a chatbot!
This looks impressive. Are there any downsides to chatting bots, though?


# The Most popular Chatbot Types



1. Quick answer bots
It is the one that is used to interact with the end customer via a predefined knowledge base and technical abilities that can capably respond to fixed instructions only.
 
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Chatbots
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to depict user’s input such as text or voice to an intent. 
3. Service/Action Chatbots
In order to complete the user’s request, these types of chatbots question relevant information from the user or take a certain action
4. Social Messaging Chatbots
Social messaging chatbots are amalgamated within a social messaging platform such as Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, Slack, etc, allowing customers to directly communicate with the bot, similar to the way they do with their family or friends.
5. Context Enabled Chatbots
The most advanced form of conversational bots are the contextual chatbots. In order to remember the conversations that happened earlier, these types of chatbots make use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, with particular users, to learn and grow with the passage of time. Contextual chatbots learn by experience with the user. A few examples of these chatbots are Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, etc.
6. Voice-Enabled Chatbots
These types of chatbots make personalized experiences for users. Voice enabled chatbots accept the user’s input when he/she speaks, act upon his/her request, reply to his/her queries, and perform numerous creative tasks. 

Well, if users genuinely want to solve their problems, chatbots work fine. But if someone just wants to find out how to break a chatbot and is not cooperating with AI, it is easy to confuse a bot. Your virtual assistant may fall victim to mischievous users who find provoking it funny.




# The Best User Experiences for the Best Chatbot




1. Hook Your User
The most basic chatbot user experience is to inform the user of your bot’s capabilities, so they know what to expect from it in the future.

2. When In Doubt, Be Generic
While onboarding or subscribing your users to notifications, let them know they’re in charge and can easily change their minds in the future.

3. Lead The Conversation
Bot has to take the attempt! Decide the moments in which the user starts the chat window and says hello, and take that opportunity to start a new conversation and present guidance.

4. Be Interesting
Bot should make it look like a real conversation. Don’t write  a 100-word paragraph and expect your user to read everything. Think of how would you introduce a new conversation to a friend—they want to hear the whole story. While you chat, there should be short messages and breaks. Let users to end up one paragraph when the bot “writes” the next one, and show loading speech icons on their screens as the bot “types”.

5. Make The Conversation Continuously
This method is not new, particularly among eCommerce websites and blogs. It is particularly necessary when designing chatbots, since we trust  a linear conversation and it’s all so easy for flow to be disrupted.

6. Aim The Right Audience
The  point is that you have to  know your users first⁠⁠⁠. If you don’t aim the right audience, you can end up providing content your users are not interested in, or using language that may be too formal.
If you aim the right audience, you will know how to solve one problem in the best way possible.
